## How to host your slidify HTML5 presentations on github

I failed in publish it directly to github following the the way introduced by slidify website. 

You can still do it very easily. But, first, you should know the structure of github repository. 
Assume you have a github repo named "slidify".We can work at different branches: "master" or "gh-pages".
The files in slidify/test/index.html on the branch of gh-pages could be displayed by your default github
website. e.g., chengjun.github.io/slidify/test

So the first move is to make a gh-pages, and upload your slidify stuff to this branch. You can generate new
sub-branch too. e.g., slidify/computational-communication. 

See two examples:

[http://chengjun.github.io/slidify/computational-communication](http://chengjun.github.io/slidify/computational-communication)

Anyway, enjoy your HTML5 slides host on github!
